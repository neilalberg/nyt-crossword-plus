# v2: Improvements -------------------------------------------------------------

## Chrome

- [ ] UI
  - link to the leaderboard from icon
  - link to the leaderboard plus from icon

- [ ] Insert API key into admin page automatically (see below)

## Host

- [ ] Admin page
  - [ ] Make the Admin Key a hash of a known password, then change the API Key field to be just normal password entry
  - [ ] Make an Entry Request page, a user submits the entry they think is missing and then I can approve later
  - [ ] Load data
    - [ ] Load a list of all possible usernames so we can autofill...
    - [ ] Load that day's entries onto page so I can see which ones are missing (load on change, require API key to be entered)
    - [ ] Autofill usernames from list of all usernames, warn when username is already in the db for that day
  - [ ] Chrome extension inserts the API key into the admin page

- [ ] Load only 1 week of data, separate request for the month and all

- [ ] Daily Selenium data scrape, go to url and scrape the data, then upload
  `/api/scrapeLeaderboard`
  - Use Autocode to trigger this every day 15 minutes before the crossword closes


# v3: Password Protected Groups ------------------------------------------------

## Host

- [ ] appearance improvements

- [ ] Admin page
  - [ ] Edit group members

- [ ] more restricted CORS, get proper response in Chrome 
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55769272/how-to-set-up-cors-in-netlify-serverless-function 

- [ ] Password protect groups
  - Home Page
      - Login and verify password, store a cookie if it is valid
      - Show a list of accessible groups loaded from the cookie
  - Group page, idk how to pass the password from the cookie to the backend, idk

Move password to group page, store it as a cookie -> nah, if the “security” of a plaintext password is good enough for ESPN then here is fine too

`/api/validateGroupLogin`
- get the group, if none exists return that error
- get the password, if they don't match, tell them the password it wrong

## Chrome

- [ ] cache
  - cache the saved data (date and list of names)
  - if there are no new ones from last successful request send, don't send a request


# v4: Public MVP ---------------------------------------------------------------
