v1: MVP 

- [x] use UTC offset
v2: Password Protected Groups

Dev
- [ ] Fix tsconfig to get rid of ../../../

- Home Page
    - Login and verify password, store a cookie if it is valid
    - Show a list of accessible groups loaded from the cookie
- Group page, idk how to pass the password from the cookie to the backend, idk

Move password to group page, store it as a cookie -> nah, if the “security” of a plaintext password is good enough for ESPN then here is fine too

v3: Available for Everyone

You create an account and set your username associated with you. You may only do this once and have to request me to override it if it’s wrong.

From there you can join a group using a group password in the settings page

You can see group stats and your own stats but not other people.
